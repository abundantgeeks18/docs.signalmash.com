Signalmash supports common token authentication such as those for web server, client-side, installed, and device applications.
To begin, obtain API token credentials from the Signalmash Portal. Then your client application requests an access token from Signalmash API, extracts a session token from the response, and sends the session token to the Signalmash API that you want to access.</description></item></channel></rss>
